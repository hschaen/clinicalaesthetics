<b>For expert programmer:</b>

<blockquote>
	I know you can make your own signature cool code.
	That's no doubt about it. What I'm try to do is saving your time.
	As you know, form mail programming is very boring. It's no 
	challenge at all. Why keep doing the repeated & meaningless coding.
	Try something new & fun. of cause, programming is part of fun.
